This project is a work in progress. I started it to practice some fundamental React skills. Ultimately my goal is to create a repository of information I've learned, but may not use often enough to remember. (How many quarts of oil does my wife's Jeep need for an oil change? What's that git command I need once every six months?)

Stay tuned for more :)
